### Acknowledgment & Purpose

This project was created for **learning and practice purposes**. It is primarily based on concepts and code structures demonstrated in various online tutorials and resources, which served as invaluable guides in my understanding and implementation. While I've applied my own learning and made adaptations, the core ideas and fundamental components originate from these educational materials. This repository showcases my efforts to understand and apply specific technologies and programming paradigms, rather than presenting entirely novel creation.
